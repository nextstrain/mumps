We gratefully acknowledge the authors, originating and submitting laboratories of the genetic sequences and metadata for sharing their work. Please note that although data generators have generously shared data in an open fashion, that does not mean there should be free license to publish on this data. Data generators should be cited where possible and collaborations should be sought in some circumstances. Please try to avoid scooping someone else's work. Reach out if uncertain.

**We maintain two views of mumps evolution:**

The first view is [`mumps/global`](https://next.nextstrain.org/staging/mumps/global), which focuses on the broader viral diversity for all mumps sequences submitted to GenBank that have a sequence length of 8000nt at least. Sequences are aligned to the reference sequence `MuV/Gabon/13/2[G]` [KM597072](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/KM597072). The phylogenetic tree was least-squares rooted.

The second view is [`wnv/north-america`](https://next.nextstrain.org/staging/mumps/north-america), which focuses on the North American samples with a `G` MuV genotype. Sequences are aligned to the reference sequence `MuV/Gabon/13/2[G]` [KM597072](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/KM597072). The phylogenetic tree was least-squares rooted.

#### Underlying data

We curate sequence data and metadata from NCBI as starting point for our analyses. Curated sequences and metadata are available as flat files at:

* [data.nextstrain.org/files/workflows/mumps/sequences.fasta.zst](https://data.nextstrain.org/files/workflows/mumps/sequences.fasta.zst)
* [data.nextstrain.org/files/workflows/mumps/metadata.tsv.zst](https://data.nextstrain.org/files/workflows/mumps/metadata.tsv.zst)
